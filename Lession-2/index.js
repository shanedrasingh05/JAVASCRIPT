// Here are only the questions from the Lesson 2 Exercises - Numbers and Math:

// 2a. At a restaurant, you order 1 soup for $10, 3 burgers for $8 each, and 1 ice cream for $5. Use JavaScript to calculate the cost of the order.

// let soup = 10;
// let burgers = 8;
// let iceCream = 5;
// let total = soup + (burgers * 3) + iceCream;
// console.log("The total cost of the order is $" + total);

// 2b. Youâ€™re at a restaurant with 2 friends (3 people in total) and make the same order as 2a. Calculate how much each person pays.

// let soup = 10;
// let burgers = 8;
// let iceCream = 5;
// let total = soup + (burgers * 3) + iceCream;
// let totalPerPerson = total / 3;
// console.log("Each person pays $" + totalPerPerson);

// 2c. Calculate the total cost of a toaster ($18.50) and 2 shirts ($7.50 each).

// let toaster1 = 18.50;
// let shirts = 7.50;
// let total = toaster1 + (shirts * 2);
// console.log("The total cost is $" + total);

// 2d. Calculate a 10% tax for the total in exercise 2c.

// let toaster1 = 18.50;
// let shirts = 7.50;
// let total = toaster1 + (shirts * 2);
// let totalWithTax = total * 0.1;
// console.log("The total cost with tax is $" + totalWithTax);

// 2e. Calculate a 20% tax for the total in 2c (remember that 20% = 0.2).

let toaster1 = 18.50;
let shirts = 7.50;
let total = toaster1 + (shirts * 2);
let totalWithTax = total * 0.2;
console.log("The total cost with tax is $" + totalWithTax);
